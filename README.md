# non-bayesian-behavior-paper
This folder includes all the code that summarizes data and generates the figures in the included
Subramanian, Pearson, Sommer "Bayesian and Discriminative models for Active Visual Perception 
across Saccades" behavior paper. 

The main code analysis and figure-generating code is organized under four folders depending
on the approach taken in the manuscript: "Human" for human experiments (1-3), 
"Monkey" for monkey experiments (4 and 5),and "Simulations" for the code generating model 
simulation panels in Figures 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10, and "Common Functions" for functions that 
are used across experiments.

Code for each experiment in the manuscript is in a subfolder within the folders
(e.g. Monkey --> Visual Noise corresponds to Experiment 4 in the manuscript, and 
Human --> Continuous corresponds to Experiment 3).

The file name for data summarizing includes "_summary". File names for figure-generating code
include "_plot" and the Figure number associated with the panel in the manuscript. 
 
Data (including data that are complete but cleaned according to procedures described in the Methods
and summaries by experimental condition) are in a distinct location. Link provided along with the code-sharing link.
